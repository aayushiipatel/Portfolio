    <h3>Professional Summary</h3>
    <p>I am a Cyber Security professional with over 3 years of experience in Security Operations and Incident Response. </p>
    <p>In my last role as a Sr. Cyber Defense Specialist at Citizens Bank, I worked in a 24*7 Security Operations Center to protect the bank. I have been instrumental in enhancing technologies and processes for information security analysts, collaborating with management and other cross functional teams to ensure best practices. </p>
    <p>As this was my first job out of college, I explored different areas within Cyber Security and determined that I want to move towards Application Security Engineering in particular. To expand my knowledge and build my skillset, I collaborated with the Application Security team within the Cyber Defense organization to learn SOAR automation and familiarize myself with the Agile environment of engineering.</p>
    <p>My experience with working in Incident Response and collaborating with other teams has helped me learn about the IAM processes as well. Additionally, I have a strong understanding of Cloud Security as we worked with AWS and Azure Security alerts as part of our daily job functions.</p>
    <p>My excellent communication and interpersonal skills, coupled with my ability to mentor both senior and junior engineers, have been key in fostering a collaborative and innovative culture.</p>

    <h3>Personal Background</h3>
    <p>I was born in Valsad, India and I moved to the United States in 2015. I moved around a lot growing up; apart from India and the US, I lived in Saudi Arabia for a few years as well. </p>
    <p>Moving to America after living most
        of my life in India was not easy. I still dwell on the dichotomy between American and Indian culture,
        with a respect for both. Over the years I've learned that it’s okay to feel like you’re
        neither here nor there as we are all shaped by the experiences we’ve lived through.</p>
    <p>After being in the US for 9 years, I call New York my home. Growing up, visiting New York was the biggest dream and it was so surreal when I first moved here. I still have moments when I don't believe I'm actually in NEW YORK. I love being here but I still have days when I miss India, my family there, and the food!</p>
    <p>Living in different countries has helped me grow as a person. It has taught me how to flow with
        situations, people and the world around me. I became more independent and open to new,
        exciting and sometimes terrifying challenges. And the most rewarding of all: the opportunity to learn and
        develop as a person, because it helped me discover things about myself that I never knew, my
        beliefs, my passions, my character. Through interacting with a foreign society, my eyes were
        opened to all sorts of aspects of life that would be difficult to learn in one country.</p>
